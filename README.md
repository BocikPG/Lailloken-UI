## Motivation & Philosophy
My goal with this script is to bring several QoL features to the PoE-client while staying as close to a natural in-game interface as possible, both from a design and user-friendliness point-of-view. This includes an easy and straight-forward setup, visual clarity, and a lack of required extra hotkeys and alt-tabbing.

That being said, I am not a programmer, and this is a merely a fun project and learning experience for me that I decided to share. This means I will not be taking code input or optimizations from people (unless critical bugs need to be fixed or I am hard-stuck) because learning-by-doing and problem-solving is what makes this project fun for me.
