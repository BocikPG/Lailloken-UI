## Installation & Requirements
- download the latest release here: [releases](https://github.com/Lailloken/Lailloken-UI/releases)
- this tool is an AHK script and thus requires AutoHotkey to be installed on your system
- like most PoE overlays, it needs the PoE client to run in windowed fullscreen

## Motivation & Philosophy
This script is my personal collection of features and improvements, with the goal of bringing several QoL features to the PoE-client while staying as close to a natural in-game interface as possible, both from a design and user-friendliness point-of-view. This includes an easy and straight-forward setup, visual clarity, customizability, the ability to decide which features to enable/disable, and a lack of required extra hotkeys and alt-tabbing.

That being said, I am a self-taught tinkerer, and this is a merely a fun project and learning experience for me that I decided to share. This means I will not be taking code input or optimizations from people (unless critical bugs need to be fixed or I am hard-stuck) because learning-by-doing and problem-solving is what makes this project fun for me.

However, I am very open to suggestions and ideas from other players. So if you have ideas on how to improve PoE-gameplay or this script, post them in the [ideas & feedback section](https://github.com/Lailloken/Lailloken-UI/discussions/categories/ideas-feedback).
